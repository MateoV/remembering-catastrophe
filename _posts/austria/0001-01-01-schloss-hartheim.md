This castle near Linz was one of the chief centers of the Nazi's T-4 "euthanasia" program. Between 1940 and 1944 as many as 30,000 persons were killed here, most by gassing or lethal injection. The castle housed an institution for children with disabilities around turn of the 20th century. 

Today, in addition to the historical exhibits about the Nazi era, it is an educational center promoting awareness of the social and economic challenges, as well as the human rights, of persons with physical and mental disabilities.
