Lublin, a leading center of Jewish learning since the late Middle Ages in eastern Poland, was occupied by the Germans in September 1939, a few weeks after the start of World War II. Its pre-war population of 40,000, representing over 30% of the city's total population, increased in the weeks prior to occupation as Jews trying to escape from the German invaders in the western part of the country arrived. For a while the Nazi's envisioned a large reservation for Jews near Lublin as part of a territorial solution to the "Jewish Question," the so-called "Nisko Plan." When this was deemed impractical, a ghetto was established in Lublin in 1941. Most Jews imprisoned in or near Lublin were departed to Majdanek or Bełżec. Lublin was administrative headquarters for *Aktion Reinhard*, the operation to plunder and murder the Jews of the General Government. 

The New Jewish Cemetery and a nearby park include several Holocaust memorial stones.
