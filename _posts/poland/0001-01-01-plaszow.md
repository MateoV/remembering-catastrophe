Established as forced labor camp in a south suburb of Kraków in 1942, Płaszów was expanded into a concentration camp after the liquidation of Kraków's Jewish ghetto in 1943. By 1944 as many as 25,000 prisoners were held there. The stark conditions of the camp are memorably depicted in Steven Spielberg's *Schindler’s List*, as is the sadistic commandant of the camp, Amon Goeth.
