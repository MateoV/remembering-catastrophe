Zamość is a Renaissance town in southeastern Poland that was to be a regional headquarters for the resettlement of thousands of ethnic Germans. The 12-13,000 Jews who lived there in 1940 represented more than 40% of the population. Most were murdered at nearby Bełżec. Many Poles and Jews were killed at the town fortress known as the Rotunda.

Today the Rotunda is a memory site with displays and materials in each of its rooms. There are several additional smaller memorials around the town honoring the victims of the Nazis.
