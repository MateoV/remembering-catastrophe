Located in south central Germany near the border with the Czech Republic, Flossenbürg was a concentration and labor camp with an extensive network of satellite camps. Many of its inmates&mdash;labeled political enemies, criminals, or "asocials" by the Nazis&mdash;were assigned to work in the nearby granite quarries. Few Jews were imprisoned here until 1944 when thousands arrived from Hungary and Poland on death marches. Protestant theologian and anti-Nazi conspirator Dietrich Bonhoeffer was hanged here on April 9, 1945. More than 90,000 persons were imprisoned in Flossenbürg over the course of its existence, about a third of whom died in the camp.
