This nineteenth century fort on the outskirts of Kaunas (Kovno), Lithuania, was used as a prison between World War I and World War II and as an execution site from June 1941 through the summer of 1944. More than 50,000 persons were murdered in the Ninth, and other, forts (primarily the Seventh, and Fourth), many of whom were Jews from the Kovno ghetto and other places in Lithuania, as well as deportees from Germany.
