Salaspils was a "work and education" camp for former Soviet prisoners of war and other political prisoners located near Riga. Medical experimentation on children was conducted at the camp. In all, 12,000-15,000 persons were interred here during the course of the war, with several thousand persons dying in the camp. Some post-war Soviet sources claimed 50-100,000 were killed here.
