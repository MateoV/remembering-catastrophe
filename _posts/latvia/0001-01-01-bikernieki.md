Perhaps as many of 40,000 Jews, many of whom had been deported to Riga from the Reich, were murdered at this forest site beginning in the mid-summer of 1941.

The main memorial is set in clearing amidst hundreds of irregularly shaped stones standing on end. From the memorial a path leads into the forest, along which are low rectangular enclosures representing the mass graves at shooting sites.
