More than 25,000 Jews from the Riga ghetto and thousands of Jews from Greater Germany were murdered in late November and early December 1941 by *Einsatzgruppe* A and auxiliaries at this forest site about 5 miles outside of Riga.

The memorial includes a number of common Jewish cemetery motifs. The road to the memorial is marked by a massive structure of twisted metal and stones that extends out toward the highway leading to Riga.
